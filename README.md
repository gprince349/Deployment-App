# Deployment-App
This is a two page application for rendering analytics related to deployment app
The project was part of my internship at Schlumberger.
We had to Develop an operational dashboard to measure the overall performance of DELFI offerings (a cloud-based platform ) tracked within the Deployment status app.
Earlier all the analytics parts were handled manually, so we decided to create a portal where users can see all the important analyses in one place without the hassle of calculating them individually.
